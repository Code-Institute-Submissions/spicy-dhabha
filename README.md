 Solution- Solved by using correct example from bootstrap documentation.

2. Modal Design coming up before book table form validation. 
  Solution-  Due to limited use of HTML and CSS it is not possible to introduced this at current level of knowlede.
  So Modal code is removed from the book-table.html. Instead it is redirected to thank-you.html page
